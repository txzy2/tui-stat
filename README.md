## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/txzy2/tui-stat/releases) page.
Each release includes binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Quick Install (Linux/macOS)

To install the latest version automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txzy2/tui-stat/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run the install script manually:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txzy2/tui-stat/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Note**: If the installation runs without root privileges, the binary will be installed to `~/.local/bin`. Make sure this directory is in your PATH by adding it to your shell configuration:

For zsh (default on macOS):
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

For bash:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Prerequisites

The installation script requires the following tools to be available on your system:
- `curl` - for downloading assets
- `tar` - for extracting .tar.gz archives (most Linux/macOS systems have this by default)
- `unzip` - for extracting .zip archives (required for Windows binaries)
