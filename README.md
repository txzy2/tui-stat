## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Install (Linux/macOS)

To install the latest version automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txzy2/tui-stat/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run the install script manually:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txzy2/tui-stat/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Note**: If the installation runs without root privileges, the binary will be installed to `~/.local/bin`. Make sure this directory is in your PATH by adding it to your shell configuration:

For zsh (default on macOS):
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

For bash:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### From Source

To build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/txzy2/tui-stat.git
cd tui-stat
cargo build --release
./target/release/tui_stat
```

### Pre-built Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/txzy2/tui-stat/releases) page.
Each release includes binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

#### Prerequisites

The installation script requires the following tools to be available on your system:
- `curl` - for downloading assets
- `tar` - for extracting .tar.gz archives (most Linux/macOS systems have this by default)
- `unzip` - for extracting .zip archives (required for Windows binaries)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To get weather information, you need to set up an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api):

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Get your API key from the account dashboard
3. Create a `.env` file in your home directory or in the project root:

```env
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
